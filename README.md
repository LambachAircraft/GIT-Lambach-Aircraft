In order to get access to the most recent version of the files, simply go to git desktop and click on "fetch origin" at the top of the screen, after that you will have to click on "pull origin".

Whenever you make modifications to a file, it is important to go back to GIT desktop and commit your changes (also include a quick description of what you did).

Before commiting ALWAYS make sure to fetch and pull origin or you will overwrite all the changes that someone else potentially made !!

n.b: only one person can work on a file at a time, so make sure so organise your work properly
